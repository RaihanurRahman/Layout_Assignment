# JavaScript task

1. There will be some numbers in an array. You have to find the 2nd largest number and 2nd smallest number by iterating the array only once.

2. There will be some numbers in an array, and you have to count the frequency of the numbers and print the frequency with the number. Like : 

                          24 - 3 times
                          17 - 1 time
                          19 - 2 times
  
3. Write a function that will take a string as input and then count how many words are there in the string. Words are separate by one or more spaces. You should use string and       array functions to accomplish the task.

4. Declare a 2D array and initialize each cell of that 2D matrix with a sequential number. That is a 4x4 matrix will be populated with numbers from 1 to 16. The top left corner       cell should be 1 and bottom right should be 16. That is, array [ 0][0] should be 1 and array[3][3] should be 16. The array values should be set using for loops.

5. Draw a Diamond shape using loops. Use single * to generate shapes of different sizes. The following sample is for size 3

                        *
                       ***
                      *****
                       ***
                        *
                        
6. Create a function that can convert 24 hour based time to 12 hour based time and vise versa. If you find AM or PM in the input string, then you consider the time is in 12 hour,     otherwise in 24 hour and you return the opposite time string.

7. Write a function to convert a number into string representation. For example, 124 should be converted to “One hundred and twenty four”. This task is not so simple, consider all   types of input cases for proper English representation. You should count up to billions.
